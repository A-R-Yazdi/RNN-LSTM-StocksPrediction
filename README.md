# Predicting Stocks using Recurrent Neural Networks with Long Short Term Memory in Keras

## Summary
Google stocks data from 2012 to 2016 for training and some in 2017 for testing were collected from Kaggle. After importing packages and data, the data was reformatted to sequential data with 60 time steps. The data was then trained using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) units and dropouts. In the end, the predicted data for opening price was compared with actual data for 2017.
